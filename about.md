Drawing upon knowledge gained from generating, wrangling, and reporting on datasets, I have an eye for both the big picture and the minutiae of systems. My business management education informs my tech skill set and enhances my ability to find valuable business insights.  

A former boss has gone on record to say the following: _“Frank is thorough, methodical and detail oriented. He is very insightful, cuts through the crap and distills an issue down to the heart of the matter.”_
